We like to take as long as it takes to decide if we are a good fit for each other.  Trials are treated as full members in every way and are allowed to roll on loot and use guild-provided flasks from cauldrons.\n\nIf you are looking for feedback on your trial, please reach out to an officer or anyone in the guild of your class/role.  All are more than happy to walk through logs with you and let you know where you might be able to improve your performance. \n\nTrials are expected to be on the server for the duration of their trial period. This is because the community is very important to us and we want you to be not only part of our raid but part of our wider guild community.  If you have extenuating circumstances that will delay your transfer to Turalyon by a week or more, please reach out.\n\n**Turalyon is our home and it's a small server economically. Consider researching raiding materials costs to see if it is advantageous for you to bring over materials with you.**",

Too often these fights just don't allow for a lot of variability in our class and player comps.

We don't expect 90+ percentile parses, but we do expect a minimum of Blue-level output performance, high survivability, and upward trajectory of overall performance of your alt. We don't require alts, so if you are going to have one and you're not making the effort, then neither is Leadership.*\n**Alts are held to the same standard as your main.**\n> *There is really no way around this. Our common commodity is time, don't waste it.*\n**Alts are not beyond redemption.**\n> *Sometimes, alts come in and just suck. It happens.
