Domination Arrows always chain to the closest person. Getting chained clears your Barbed Arrow bleed. We may need to use this to manage the dot, may not. On testing barbed arrow did not stack fast enough for this to matter.\n3. Veil of Darkness (the huge black circle) won’t kill you when you get hit, but if multiple people get clipped by it, the debuff will spread and cause massive healing problems. This can wipe us very fast and comes ~15s after chains spawn.\n4. You cannot melee your own domination arrow, if you get in melee range of it you will be instantly killed. You can melee anyone else’s arrow. This is important for the intermission at the end of p1 when everyone will get chained\n5. The tankbuster is unique on this fight. If she has 3 or more stacks of Heartseeker, she replaces her next auto attack with a tankbuster. This is annoyingly inconsistent.\n6. The arena is huge and wailing arrow’s falloff radius is similar to xymox bomb. Tanks don’t go too far with this or you’ll cause range issues.\n7. When the boss hits 80% we’ll get an intermission where every player is chained and the boss launches huge massacre style lines. She will also cast a Banshee wail which does damage based on missing HP and splashes within 5 yards, so some big throughput CDs will be saved for this phase.",
